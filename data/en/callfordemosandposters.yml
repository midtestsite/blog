pageTitle: CALL FOR DEMOS AND POSTERS

texts:
  - text : 'Middleware 2021 will provide a forum for live software demonstrations of middleware applications, systems, and tools. Demos could take a wide and open-ended variety of forms. Typical examples include: (i) presentation of an application that leverages advanced middleware concepts, (ii) working through coding of an example on a novel middleware platform, or (iii) real-time visualizations of middleware system metrics under simulated workloads. Although the form may vary, demo presenters should take advantage of not being constrained by the format of a traditional slide presentation. Demos are encouraged for both early prototypes and mature technology.'
  - text : 'Posters will provide an opportunity for conference attendees to learn about innovative work in progress and to preview late-breaking research results. Poster sessions will provide an informal setting for presenters to communicate ideas & results, as well as to collect feedback from attendees.'
  - text : 'Demo or poster contributions are solicited in all areas of middleware research and applications. For a list of applicable topics, please consider the full list of them in the call for papers of the main conference.'
