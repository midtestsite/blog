    title: Overview
    texts:
      - text: We will give authors the option to present their work live. The duration of talks will be 10 minutes, during which authors should provide an overview of their work, followed by 5 minutes of questions by the audience.
      - text: Although authors can present their work live, <b>\*all authors\*</b> are required to upload a 20-minute video of their extended talk. The first 10 minutes of the extended-talk video should provide an overview of the authors' work, whereas the remaining 10 minutes can offer in-depth technical details. The first 10 minutes of the extended-talk video will be streamed during the technical session for authors who choose not to present their work live.
      - text: Irrespective whether the talk is presented live or broadcasted from the recording, <b>at least one author</b> from each paper <b>\*must be present\*</b> to answer questions for the 5 minutes Q&A period.
      - text: <b>This page</b> contains instructions on how to submit and upload videos. Authors must attend their respective Zoom sessions for the Q&A immediately following their live talk or the broadcast of their video, according to the moderation of the session chair. In addition, dedicated Slack channels for each session will be available throughout the conference to allow for asynchronous discussions and coordinate the sessions.

  content:
    title: Content of the video recording
    texts:
      - text : Authors should treat the video recording as a direct substitute for a physical presence. Thus, the audio should contain a spoken narration of the presentation, and the accompanying video should include a complete walkthrough of the presentation slides. The presenter is also strongly encouraged to overlay a thumbnail-sized camera feed showing the speaker.
      - text : "For authors presenting live, please add some 2-3 discussion points to your conclusion slide. For those who choose to broadcast their extended-talk video, please include the discussion points right after the first half of your presentation. As the talks are intentionally kept short for the online format, there are likely points not discussed during the presentation, such as technical details or future work. Although you can address these in your extended-talk video, please highlight them after the first half of your presentation to facilitate questions during the Q&A."
