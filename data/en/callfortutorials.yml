  - text: Over the past decade, the ACM International Conference on Distributed and Event‐based Systems (DEBS) has become the premier venue for academia and industry to discuss cutting-edge research of event-based computing related to Big Data, AI/ML, IoT and Distributed Systems. The objectives of the ACM International Conference on Distributed and Event‐Based Systems (DEBS) are to provide a forum dedicated to the dissemination of original research, the discussion of practical insights, and the reporting of experiences relevant to distributed systems and event‐based computing. The conference aims at providing a forum for academia and industry to exchange ideas.
  - text: DEBS 2020 will host a one-day, multi-track tutorial program to provide independent instruction on topics related to distributed and event-based computing, both fitting for the research audience and to an industrial audience. We solicit both long (2 sessions) and short (1 session) tutorials. A tutorial may cover a wide scope of topics ranging from practical techniques and guidelines over relevant standards through to theoretical work. Please note that no marketing or product-specific tutorials will be accepted. Tutorial levels may be introductory, intermediate, or advanced. Topics of broad interest are preferred.
