  abstract: "The advent of IoT has seen an explosive growth in the number of connected devices generating a large variety of data in high volumes at high velocities. The unique set of requirements posed by IoT demands innovation in the communication and information infrastructure to make them massively distributed for achieving scalability; secure against cyberattacks; highly interoperable for seamless interaction between different enabling technologies; highly flexible for collecting, fusing, mining, and processing IoT data; and easily programmable for service orchestration and application-enablement. This talk will discuss our experience developing and operating such an infrastructure across Canada as part of the Smart Applications on Virtualized Infrastructure project, highlighting some of the underlying management and security challenges. In particular, traditional human-in-the-loop management operations are costly, error-prone, and slow to adapt to changes. Automation can address these challenges and has been the holy grail of network management research for decades, however with limited practical deployment. We believe that the stars are now aligned to realize this long-term vision. This talk will discuss some of the research directions in this perspective with particular focus on programmable network monitoring leveraging network softwarization, predictive machine learning for automated management decision making, on-demand orchestration of network services, and IoT security empowered by blockchains."
  bio: "Raouf Boutaba is a University Chair Professor and Director in the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. He also holds the INRIA International Chair in France. He is the founding Editor in Chief of the IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management (2007-2010), and the current Editor-in- Chief of the IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications (JSAC). His research interests are in the areas of network and service management. He has published extensively in these areas and received several journal and conference Best Paper Awards such as the IEEE 2008 Fred W. Ellersick Prize Paper Award. He also received other recognitions, including the Premierâ€™s Research Excellence Award, Industry research excellence Awards, fellowships of the Faculty of Mathematics, of the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science and outstanding performance awards at the University of Waterloo. He has also received the IEEE Communications Society Hal Sobol Award and the IFIP Silver Core in 2007, the IEEE Communications Society Joe LociCero and the Dan Stokesbury awards in 2009, the Salah Aidarous award in 2012, the McNaugthon Gold Medal in 2014, the Technical Achievement Award of the IEEE Technical Committee on Information Infrastructure and Networking as well as the Donald W. McLellan Meritorious Service Award in 2016. He served as a distinguished lecturer for the IEEE Computer and Communications Societies. He is fellow of the IEEE, the Engineering Institute of Canada, the Canadian Academy of Engineering, and the Royal Society of Canada."

  abstract: "Climate change is considered the biggest threat and challenge currently facing humanity. The scientific community have established that failing to keep the global temperature from rising above the upper limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius will have dire consequences, including world hunger, degraded health, and political instability. Attention is increasing to the role that technology plays in relationship with climate change. Some are concerned about the energy consumption toll of technology, and in particular, emerging energy-devouring workloads such as AI. The end of Dennard Scaling implies that new approaches are needed to meet the exponential increase in demand for computation.
As technologists we have responsibility to improve the efficiency of system, software, and management software. Cloud computing in particular ought to be scrutinized closely. Cloud computing promises efficiency gains, however, third party clouds, despite the PR noise, are yet to adopt openness and clear methodology to enable meaningful quantification of the actual carbon footprint cost of client workloads. New trends, such as the commercialization of renewable energy, and system innovation such as specialized hardware open the door for new research opportunities. I will discuss the challenges and the new research directions in this exciting and important area of sustainable computing and cloud."
  bio: "Dr Tamar Eilam is an IBM Fellow in the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, in New York. Dr Eilam has twenty years of experience leading innovation in cloud computing. Her recent focus is Cloud and Climate. Specifically, she leads research on the quantification and reduction of carbon footprint associated with cloud workloads through innovation in system, software and management software. Tamar completed her Ph.D. in 2000 in Computer Science in the Technion, Israel, and joined IBM Research as a Research Staff Member that same year. Tamar is the author of numerous award-winning publications and patents, and an experienced international speaker."
