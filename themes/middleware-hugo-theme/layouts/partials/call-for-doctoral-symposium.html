            <p align="justify">The annual ACM/IFIP Middleware conference will include a doctoral symposium, to which all PhD students working on the topics of the Middleware conference are invited to apply. The doctoral symposium will be held prior to the main conference.</p>
            <p align="justify">The goal of the doctoral symposium is to provide a welcoming and supportive environment where PhD students working in related fields can receive feedback, discuss their work, and prepare to get the most out of their participation in the main conference. All participating students will be offered the opportunity to engage with their peers, as well as with senior academic and industrial members of the Middleware community. This will include the feedback of panel members on the day of the symposium and individual meetings with a personal mentor during the conference. The symposium is open to PhD students at any stage of their studies.</p>

            </ul>
            {{ end }}
            <p align="justify">All PhD students carrying out research on middleware topics are invited to submit a position paper to the doctoral symposium. Papers will be peer-reviewed by the symposium’s committee of selected mentors. The criteria for accepting papers includes the extent of the contribution of the work to the field, the originality of the problem, and the overall quality of the position paper. Position papers should fit within the research topics of the Middleware 2021 main conference.</p>

            <h1>SUBMISSION GUIDELINES</h1>
            <p align="justify">Position papers are limited to 2 pages (for early-stage research students) or 4 pages (for late-stage research students). Students should identify the category they belong to.  Submissions must use the same format as for the research papers. The suggested format is detailed on the Middleware 2021 website. Please see the submission format for the research track. </p>
            <p align="justify">The submissions should include an author name and associated affiliation: the only author should be the PhD student (other contributors, e.g., the PhD student’s advisor(s), can be acknowledged in a separate section at the end). The students should ask a letter of reference from their PhD advisor, which should accompany the submission.</p>
            <p align="justify">Contributions to the Middleware 2021 Doctoral symposium will appear in the proceedings that supplements the main conference proceedings.</p>
            <p align="justify">Accepted position paper will lead to a presentation during the doctoral symposium.</p>
