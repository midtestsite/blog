            <p align="justify">The annual ACM/IFIP Middleware conference is a major forum for the discussion of innovations and recent advances in the design, construction, and use of middleware systems. Middleware is the software that resides between applications and the underlying architecture and platforms, often with an emphasis on networked computing. The goal of middleware is to facilitate the development of applications by providing higher-level abstractions for better programmability, performance, scalability, and security. It is a rapidly evolving and growing field.</p>
            <p align="justify">The Middleware conference traditionally includes a number of high-quality workshops. We invite experts on related research subjects to submit one-day or half-day workshop proposals within the scope of Middleware 2021. Proposed workshops can be on any topic related to middleware, but we are particularly interested in workshops focusing on emerging middleware areas.</p>

            <h1>WORKSHOP PROPOSAL SUBMISSION</h1>
            <p align="justify">Each workshop proposal, not exceeding three pages of 11pt single-spaced text, in PDF format, should include the following information:</p>
            <ul class="default-ul">
              {{ range $data.callforworkshops.submission }}
                <li>{{ .li }}</li>
              {{ end }}
            </ul>
            <p align="justify">Each workshop will organize its own submissions and reviewing procedures and will provide its own website. A link will be provided to the workshop’s website from the Middleware 2021 website. Workshop organizers will ensure that all accepted papers are peer reviewed and will need to upload camera ready and copyright agreements of all accepted papers in a timely manner through the ACM portal. Organizers will plan their workshop’s schedule so that: (i) the paper submission deadline falls after the main conference's second round notification date (15 August 2021); (ii) authors are notified no later than September 30, 2021; and (iii) authors submit their camera-ready papers no later than October 25, 2021. Accepted workshop papers should be no longer than 6 pages in the standard ACM format. Note that at least one author on each accepted workshop paper must hold a full pre-conference registration, as must at least one workshop organizer. Workshop organizers are responsible for preparing the papers for their workshops in the format required by ACM. As in previous years, the Middleware conference organizers will provide companion proceedings including all workshop papers, which will be available in the ACM Digital Library. This is subject to the availability of their camera-ready papers by October 25, 2021.</p>
            <p align="justify">Middleware requires workshop organizers to use HotCRP (<a href="https://hotcrp.com/" target="_blank">https://hotcrp.com/</a>) to collect submissions, manage reviewing, and facilitate collection of material for the proceedings. HotCRP is free of charge for Middleware workshops and provides many useful tools, such as to manage copyright assignment, final-version submission, PDF checking, and proceedings construction.</p>
